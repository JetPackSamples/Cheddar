# [WIP] Cheddar for Hacker News
![Build status](https://github.com/adrianblancode/Cheddar/workflows/Build/badge.svg) ![Test status](https://github.com/adrianblancode/Cheddar/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)
 
Cheddar is a social news reader for Hacker News. Currently it's being entirely rewritten with: 

*   UI layer entirely in Compose.
*   Single activity fully Compose first architecture, based on composable units of business logic to drive both app behavior and the UI layer.
*   Dagger with high modularization.
*   Kotlin Coroutines / Flow for asynchronous work.
*   Retrofit / OkHttp / Kotlin Serialization for networking.
*   Tests and CI pipeline.
*   Fancy animations, Day/Night mode, drawing behind insets, and more.

As Compose hasn't even entered alpha yet, the some parts of the app might be **very** janky for now.
