# [WIP] Cheddar for Hacker News


![Build status](https://github.com/adrianblancode/Cheddar/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

Cheddar is a social news reader for Hacker News. Currently it's being entirely rewritten with: Kotlin + Flow, Compose-first architecture, Dagger, modularization, day/night mode, insets and fancy animations. As Compose hasn't entered alpha yet, things might be very unstable for now.

Featured on [XDA-Developers](http://www.xda-developers.com/apps-of-the-week-material-facebook-hacker-news-web-making-and-pac-man/), "Well-designed social news readers of this caliber do not come very often"
